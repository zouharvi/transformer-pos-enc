TEXT_WIKIPEDIA = """In July 2012, it was reported that Wikipedia was "running out of administrators". This was because in 2006-2007 an average of 40-50 new administrators were appointed. In the first six months of 2012 only 9 new administrators were appointed.[7][8] But the co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, did not believe that this was a crisis. He also did not believe Wikipedia was running out of admins. He thought the number of admins did not change much.[9] Wales said earlier that being an admin is "not a big deal”. He also said that "It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.” He said this in a message he sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003. [10] The first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales himself in October 2001.[11] Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. The process has been said to be "akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. Lih also said, "It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was "prove you weren't a bozo".[7] Editors can become candidates only after "extensive work on the wiki".[2] Any editor can vote in an RfA. The result of the vote is not by the number of votes for or against, but by the consensus that has been reached. The decision if a consensus has been reached can only be made by a bureaucrat. A bureaucrat is a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a "request" process which is much stricter for them than for administrators.[12] This RfA process was started after RfAs attracted a lot of attention. Before the middle of 2005, RfAs did not attract a lot of attention. But then RfAs started attracting groups of editors who all supported one another.[13] Wikipedia administrators are senior, trusted volunteers who have been selected by the Wikipedia community.[1] They are also known as admins, sysops, and janitors[2]:327. Administrators are chosen following a successful request for adminship. As of May 2021, there are 16 administrators on the Simple English Wikipedia.[3] Administrators have special rights that other editors do not have.  On Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being \"given [or taking up] the mop\",[3] a term which has also been used elsewhere.[4]  In his book Wikipedia – The Missing Manual, John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role. Instead, he says, admins usually \"delete pages\" and \"protect pages involved in edit wars\".[5] The Simple English Wikipedia is a variation in which most of the articles use only basic English vocabulary (simplewiki). There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon) Wikipedia (angwiki). It has a newsletter called The Signpost.  Wikipedias in other languages have imitated some of its technical and organizational features.  As the English Wikipedia is very popular, there can be many people editing the wiki in one minute. This made the Special:RecentChanges less effective for understanding changes. Instead, editors can select and watch for changes in particular articles, using the \"watchlist\" feature of MediaWiki. Some also use special software to detect and fix vandalism.[3][4]  Some people think that the English Language Wikipedia shows bias and unfairness.[5] Editors of reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned Wikipedia's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[6] An example of bias is that around 90% of Wikipedia editors are male.[7] Other people think that Wikipedia is more useful than other encyclopedias because it is large and can be updated quickly. The English language Wikipedia page from 18 January 2012, illustrating its international blackout in opposition to SOPA and PIPA.  In 2012, the logo of the English Wikipedia like most Wikipedias was slightly changed. However, some Wikipedias, like the Simple English Wikipedia, still kept the old logo. The English Wikipedia is the English language edition of the Wikipedia online encyclopedia. English is the first language in which Wikipedia was written. It was started on 15 January 2001. It is the largest encyclopedia in the world, and the largest version of Wikipedia since April 2019.[1] It has more than 6,085,700 articles as of May 2020.[2] In October 2015, the total volume of the compressed texts of the English Wikipedia's articles added up to 11.5 gigabytes. The Simple English Wikipedia is an English-language version of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, that is written at a basic level of English.[1] It was created on September 18, 2001. All of the articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use shorter sentences and easier words and grammar than the regular English Wikipedia. Other people use the Simple English Wikipedia because the basic language helps them understand hard ideas or topics they do not know about. Many articles are shorter than the same articles in the English Wikipedia. Technical subjects use some terms that are not simple. Editors try to explain these terms in a simple way. This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the ordinary English Wikipedia. If someone cannot understand an idea in complex English, they can read the Simple English article. When the Simple English Wikipedia started creation of pages and allowing changes in 2003, the ordinary English Wikipedia already had 150,000 articles. Seven other Wikipedias in other languages also had over 15,000 articles. Since the other Wikipedias already have so many articles, most Simple English articles take articles from other Wikipedias and make them simple; they are usually not new articles. Right now, the Simple English Wikipedia has 188,855"""
